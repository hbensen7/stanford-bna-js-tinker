# What I set out to learn
I set out to learn Vega-Lite.  

# What I built
I build a visualization in vega lite which shows an isotype plot where there are 100 human icons, 75 of which are colored blue to represent male and 25 of which are colored pink to represent female. 

The plot was taken from [this example](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/isotype_grid.html) in the Vega-Lite example plots, but I added an additional variable noting the "sex" of the person, colored the plot by sex, moved the JavaScript code to another file, and added CSS styling in another file. 

I have thus uploaded four files: 
1. humans_plot.html
2. charts.js
3. styles.css
4. README.md

NOTE: PLEASE IGNORE usable-vega-lite-plot.html. That's something I was tinkering with and is in my repo for Carlo to play with. 

# How I learned Vega-Lite
To learn it, I explored the following resources
1. On Vega-Lite's GitHub page, I reviewed their [documentation page](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/), their [examples](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/), their [tutorials page](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/tutorials/getting_started.html), and their [online editor](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/edited). 

I also watched part of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsrz4YdaZ_A) from Vega-Lite's developers which helped me understand the four operator view specifications of Vega-Lite (Layers, Facets, Concats, and Repeats). 

Finally, I used ChatGPT to help me understand and develop parts of the code. 

# Assessment of degree of mastery
I understand the fundamentals of Vega-Lite and how to manipulate charts, but I'm still a beginner in this technique. I would need more practice building more visualizations to truly master this technique. That said, I think I understand the building blocks of Vega-Lite and could explain to someone the fundamentals and what resources are available to deepen your understanding.
